.SYNOPSIS
Sets the LMCompatibilityLevel to a weaker value, allowing fallback to NTLMv1.

.DESCRIPTION
This script modifies the registry key "LmCompatibilityLevel" to weaken NTLM authentication settings.  
Setting it to 2 permits NTLMv1 responses while still supporting NTLMv2.  
This can make systems vulnerable to NTLM downgrade attacks.  

Value mapping:
0 = Send LM & NTLM responses  
1 = Send LM & NTLM â€“ use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated  
2 = Send NTLM response only (current setting in this script)  
3 = Send NTLMv2 response only  
4 = Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM  
5 = Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM
