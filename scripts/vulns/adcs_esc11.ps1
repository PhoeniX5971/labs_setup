<#
.SYNOPSIS
Disables enforcement of encrypted certificate requests on a Certification Authority (ESC11).

.DESCRIPTION
This script makes a CA vulnerable by disabling enforcement of encrypted certificate requests.  
It sets the `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` flag on the CA, which allows unencrypted requests.  
This misconfiguration enables impersonation attacks and is commonly referred to as ESC11.

If the CA service is not installed, the script installs and configures a default Enterprise Root CA 
(for lab/testing purposes).

.REQUIREMENTS
- Must be run with Administrator privileges on the CA server.
- PowerShell must be running elevated.

.EXAMPLE
PS> .\enable_ESC11.ps1
Disables encrypted certificate request enforcement and makes the CA vulnerable to ESC11.
